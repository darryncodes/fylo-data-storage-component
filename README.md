## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   SCSS
-   JS
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   BEM methodology

### What I learned

I used this challenge to learn more abbout accessibility. I focused on using the correct semantic mark up, custom focus states, aria-label and ensured I removed all animations, transitions and smooth scroll for people that prefer not to see them.

-   [When to use aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)

### Continued development

-   I'd like to really delve into accessibility and make sure it's a fundamental part of my process.
